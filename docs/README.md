# AwesomeWM Configuration

Welcome to my AwesomeWM config! This repo contains my personalized setup for the Awesome Window Manager, a highly configurable, dynamic window manager for X. Whether you're looking to customize your own AwesomeWM setup or just curious about how I've configured mine, feel free to explore, fork, or contribute!

## Features

- **Gruvbox-Theme**:
- **Colemak-dh**:

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Clusterfonk/awesome ~/.config/awesome
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have AwesomeWM installed.

3. **PLACEHOLDER**:

## Customization

Feel free to tweak the configuration to your liking. The configuration is modular, so you can easily add or remove components without affecting the rest of the setup.

- **Themes**: Located in `theme/`, you can switch themes by modifying the `theme.lua` file.
- **Widgets**: Custom widgets can be found in `ui/widgets/`.
- **Keybindings**: Keybindings are defined in `configuration/keys/`.
